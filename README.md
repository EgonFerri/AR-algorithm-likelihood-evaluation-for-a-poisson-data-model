# AR-algorithm-&-likelihood-evaluation-for-a-poisson-data-model
 
1) A-R ALGORITHM
a) Show how it is possible to simulate from a standard Normal distribution using pseudo-random deviates from a standard Cauchy and the A-R algorithm
b) Provide your R code for the implementation of the A-R
c) Evaluate numerically (approximately by MC) the acceptance probability
d) Write your theoretical explanation about how you have conceived your Monte Carlo estimate of the acceptance probability
e) Save the rejected simulations and provide a graphical representation of the empirical distribution (histogram or density estimation)
f) Derive the underlying density corresponding to the rejected random variables and try to compare it with the empirical distribution

2) MARGINAL LIKELIHOOD EVALUATION FOR A POISSON DATA MODEL
a) Exact analytic computation
b) By Monte Carlo approximation
c) By Monte Carlo Importance sampling
